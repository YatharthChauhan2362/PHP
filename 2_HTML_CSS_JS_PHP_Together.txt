How HTML, CSS, JavaScript & PHP Work Together

---> How do Websites work?

-> The basic technologies to build any website are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
    For some server-side processing such as getting a response from some other website or storing data in a database, Php or any other backend programming language is required.

-> Let's try to understand these components of a website with the help of a car example. 
   The body of the car can be considered as HTML, its paint, and decorations as CSS, and the engine as JavaScript. 
   Just like the components of a car that performs various functions, HTML (hypertext mark-up language) is the main skeleton of a website which usually works with predefined tags. 
   This skeleton can be compared with the car's body.

-> CSS (Cascading style sheets) is used to make the website enhanced with different colors and animations. CSS is analogical with the paint and decorations of a car. 
   JavaScript is also used to perform some sort of scripting, advanced actions with the website components. JS is used to make the website dynamic using client-side scripting.

-> On the other hand, PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a very popular language for website development. 
   It executes scripts on the server-side. Php is easy enough to become the beginner's first scripting language. 
   In fact, I started my web development journey with PHP and never regretted the decision.

-> Whenever a client requests a website page from the browser, an HTTP request is received and processed by the server. 
   The server gives some response in return which consists of HTML, CSS, and JS, depending upon our code, request, and complexity of the website. 
   This response is then rendered and shown by the web browser.
