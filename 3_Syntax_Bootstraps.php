<!-- PHP Bootstrap -->

<!-- I recommend you use frontend frameworks such as Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS if you are an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript beginner. 
// Bootstrap is a framework to assist you with planning HTML components in your sites quicker and simpler. 
// It incorporates HTML and CSS-based components for forms, tables, modals, images, etc. 
// It likewise gives you support for JavaScript customization as well. 
// You do not have to cram each and everything but, you should use the official bootstrap site www.getbootstrap.com whenever you need to copy any component. 
// I have copied a navbar from the bootstrap website. You can get some very good-looking nav bars that you can copy and paste in your PHP codebase and you can further edit the names, the dropdown, and other elements in the navbar. -->
